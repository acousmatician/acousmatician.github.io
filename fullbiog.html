He studied composition with Jonty Harrison at Birmingham          University (UK), and as a student there was part of the original line-up of BEAST at its founding in 1982. He          worked with BEAST throughout the Eighties and early Nineties, helping to establish the group as a leader in          acousmatic performance on the UK and international scenes. Along with acousmatic music, his more recent work          includes more music for orchestras and ensembles, but retains a strong interest in the phenomenon of sound as          raw material and the use of technology to realise new kinds of musical ideas. He is especially interested in          spatial sound, in the relationship between 'real-world' and 'abstract' sounds, and in the phenomena of aural          perception as part of the creative process.</p>        <p class="left">His music first came to prominence through the award of several international prizes, including          the EMAS/PRS Prize for 'Storm-Song' (piano and tape) in 1986, which was also featured at the Gaudeamus Music          Week (Amsterdam). Subsequent awards include First Prizes at Concours de Musique Electroacoustique de Bourges,          1997 (Ascent); Concurso Internacional ART&rsquo;S XXI, Valencia, 2001 ('Cable Bay'); Concurso internacional de          m&uacute;sica eletroac&uacute;stica, S&atilde;o Paulo, 2003 (Penmon Point); KLANG, Montpellier, 2016 ('Fern          Hill'); Destellos, Argentina, 2017 ('Skyline') and KLANG, Montpellier, 2018 ('Lebenslieder'). In 2004 he was          the recipient of a prestigious 'Euphonie d&rsquo;Or' at Bourges for one of the ten most significant works of          the decade 1995&ndash;2004 ('Ascent'), and in the same year his string quartet 'Tempo Reale' was chosen by Sir          Peter Maxwell Davies for a Wigmore Hall concert celebrating the 60th anniversary of SPNM.</p>        <p class="left">His instrumental music has been commissioned and performed by numerous prominent artists,          including the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, l'Orchestre national Montpellier Occitanie, the Kreutzer          Quartet, Psappha, Ensemble Mise-En, Ensemble Cymru, Duo Contour, UPROAR, Elinor Bennet, Jane Chapman, Wendy          Holdaway, Yoshikazu Iwamoto, Gerald Garcia, Phillip Mead, Xenia Pestova, Carla Rees, Heather Roche and          Vivienne Spiteri.</p>        <p class="left">Projects include the audiovisial work 'LEXICON' (funded by the Wellcome Trust) which was seen          live by more than 1700 people during its UK tour, and 'Fern Hill' for orchestra and electronics, which was          commissioned for the BBC National Orchestra of Wales for the centenary celebrations of Dylan Thomas, and          broadcast live on BBC Radio 3. This work won first prize in the KLANG! competition, Montpellier, and was given          its French premiere there by the Orchestre national Montpellier Occitanie. In 2016 he was awarded a Leverhulme          Research Fellowship to compose a large scale work for orchestra and electronics featuring the voices of people          with dementia and their partners who care for them ('Lebenslieder'). The resulting work was awarded second          prize in the KLANG! competition, Montpellier, in 2018. In 2019 'Straatmuziek' for flute, clarinet, piano and          electronics was one of only two works chosen to represent Wales at the ISCM World Music Days in Estonia. In          2018 he was one of ten composers from Wales commissioned for the debut concert of the UPROAR Ensemble, and in          2020 completed a new commission them for ensemble and electronics, for a tour in the UK and Europe.</p>        <p class="left">Numerous recordings are available, including two collections of his works: 'Miroirs obscurs' and          'Au-d&egrave;la' (empreintes DIGITALes) as well as 'Schattenklavier' on Shadow Piano (Innova). His          instrumental and vocal music is published by Composers Edition, and his acousmatic music by Ymx m&eacute;dia,          Montr&eacute;al (electrocd.com). </p>        <p class="left">He is married with four grown-up daughters, and lives in Bangor, North Wales.</p>      </div>      <!--- End of FULL COLUMN ---->      <div class="footer_wrapper"><?php include 'footer13.php' ?></div>      <div class="stretch">&nbsp;</div>      <!--- This is a hack to stretch the containing white area around the floated columns ----> </div>  </body></html>
