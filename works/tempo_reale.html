In doing so our perception of them changes, sometimes            dramatically.</p>          <p class="prognote">In many ways, this musical and sonic phenomenon            echoes our human experience of time. Calling past events to mind is            not simply to repeat them, but to perceive them through the            powerfully transformed echoes of memory &ndash; from another place,            another time. </p>          <p class="prognote">The musical echoes in <em>Canzon</em> take many            forms: answering or echoing phrases, sonic echoes in the imaginary            space created by loudspeakers, the echoes of fragments of            Gabrieli&rsquo;s original, echoes of musical memories from            elsewhere, echoes of echoes, double echoes&hellip; </p>          <p class="prognote">In the final section of the piece, all the music            that has gone before is echoed again, but in a changed state. It is            as if the sound of praise that echoed through St Mark&rsquo;s            Basilica now echoes beyond its walls, down through the centuries,            and then beyond even the confines of space and time, into eternity.</p>          <p class="prognote"><em>Canzon in Double Echo</em> was commissioned by            UPROAR and Michael Rafferty with support from the Arts Council of            Wales, PRS Foundation and RVW Trust. It was first performed at            Chapter Arts Centre, Cardiff, on 28 February 2020. </p>        </div>      </div>      <div class="footer_wrapper"><?php include '../footer13.php' ?> </div>      <div class="stretch">&nbsp;</div>      <!--- This is a hack to stretch the containing white area around the floated columns -->    </div>  </body></html>
