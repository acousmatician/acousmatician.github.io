        <p><em>"[His music] possesses the ability to transport the listener to somewhere beyond the concrete and the
            everyday while apparently originating from within it."</em><br>
          Stuart Marshall, <a href="http://www.thesoundprojector.com/2014/12/18/the-devils-lexicon/">The Sound
            Projector</a></p>
        <p>Andrew Lewis is a composer based in North Wales (UK). His music is primarily concerned with the materiality
          of sound, and often uses technology in its realisation and performance. He is especially interested in
          exploring the latent musicality of everyday sounds as a means of connecting more directly with listeners. His
          output ranges from 'acousmatic' music (heard solely on multiple loudspeakers) to orchestral and chamber works,
          often (but not exclusively) including technology. <a href="fullbiog.html">(Read more...)</a></p>
